# Stanford's CS231n 2019 spring solutions
All the assignments were done in Google Colab environment, thus all notebooks begin with:
1. Connecting to Google Drive containing the assignment
2. Installing packages
3. Downloading the required dataset
4. Changing directory to the current assignment

Sometimes a runtime restart is required after the initial setup of the notebook, due to conflicts with Google Colab's packages.  
Use the flags to control what happens everytime the initialization cell runs. Usually you need to download the dataset only once. Due to restarts you'd need to connect to the drive again and CD to the correct directory, but you don't need to install packages again, so keep that flag as False.  
Only when a factory reset has been made or the runtime completely changed you'll need to install packages again.

### All the assignments with a DL framework were done with PyTorch.
